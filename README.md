# Reverse engineering the dengue virus


Bio stuff:
- RNA and DNA are both nucleic acids, meaning they are made of repeating subunits called nucleotides. These nucleotides (a sugar molecule covalently bonded to a phosphate molecule and to a nitrogenous base) are made of a pentose sugar, phosphate group and a base. RNA is a single stranded molecule meaning it has one long chain of nucleotides bonded by covalent bonds and the bases A, U, C and G. Also RNA has ribose as the pentose sugar
- mRNA is used in transcription where the genes of the DNA molecule are replicated onto an RNA molecule (but changing the base T in DNA for U in RNA) which then travels through the cytoplasm of the cell. In the ribosomes the tRNA basically gets groups of 3 bases where each three bases code for one amino acid and so a long chain of amino acids (protein) is made from one gene
- DNA is double stranded, has deoxyribose sugar and has a double helix shape. In DNA the 2 strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases on the 2 strands (A from one strand pairs with T from another strand and C from one strand pairs with G from another strand). They always pair up in this way. 2 hydrogen bonds are formed between A and T and 3 hydrogen bonds are formed between C and G and thatâ€™s what basically holds the double helix together.

1. So you have 4 bases
2. A and T pair up (In each strand) Of DNA
3. C and G pair up (In each strand) Of DNA
4. But in RNA U pairs up with A
5. Genome sequence in link is DNA code which is a template 
6. The two strands of DNA separate. And mRNA bases attach to one of the DNA strands which is opposite to the one it wants to replicate. So if you wanna replicate A then mRNA will attach to T (so the mRNA base is T). They keep doing that until the desired code is replicated and they have a strand of RNA which goes to the ribosome and in ribosome. 3 bases are read at the same time. Those are the triplet codons. And an amino acid matching those is brought to them. Multiple amino acids together are bound by peptide bonds and that makes a protein

Codon table to see the code and see what amino acid that codes for:

Note:
- Multiple amino acids together are bound by peptide bonds and that makes a protein


Basically:
- DNA is the template that stays inside the nucleus
- And RNA is the single strand that travels out of the nucleus into the ribosome to code for proteins
- RNA is a copy of DNA but a single strand
- Essentially DNA codes for RNA and RNA codes for proteins. But instead of T as a base RNA has U
- Codon table - multiple triplet codons code for 1 amino acid (eg AAT and AAC both code for leucine) to decrease the likelihood of mutations cos even if a base gets replaced (eg T by C) the same amino acid will be synthesized
