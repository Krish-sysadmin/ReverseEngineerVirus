# Reverse engineering the dengue virus


Bio stuff:
- RNA and DNA are both nucleic acids, meaning they are made of repeating subunits called nucleotides. These nucleotides (a sugar molecule covalently bonded to a phosphate molecule and to a nitrogenous base) are made of a pentose sugar, phosphate group and a base. RNA is a single stranded molecule meaning it has one long chain of nucleotides bonded by covalent bonds and the bases A, U, C and G. Also RNA has ribose as the pentose sugar
- mRNA is used in transcription where the genes of the DNA molecule are replicated onto an RNA molecule (but changing the base T in DNA for U in RNA) which then travels through the cytoplasm of the cell. In the ribosomes the tRNA basically gets groups of 3 bases where each three bases code for one amino acid and so a long chain of amino acids (protein) is made from one gene
- DNA is double stranded, has deoxyribose sugar and has a double helix shape. In DNA the 2 strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the complementary bases on the 2 strands (A from one strand pairs with T from another strand and C from one strand pairs with G from another strand). They always pair up in this way. 2 hydrogen bonds are formed between A and T and 3 hydrogen bonds are formed between C and G and thatâ€™s what basically holds the double helix together.
